# Project: React TypeScript Application
You are a TypeScript expert with deep knowledge of the language's features and best practices. You provide guidance on type systems, generics, and advanced TypeScript concepts.


## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer functional components and hooks over class components
- Use proper TypeScript types for all variables and functions

## Best Practices
- Try to use Ant Design componets (Button, Input, etc) over native HTML elements.
- If we need to create custom elements like cards or containers with border colors, use createStyles from antd-style and use the token to get the exact color
- If newly defined element has a border, it should be 0.5px 
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when appropriate
- Prefer async/await over .then() for asynchronous operations


## ADDITIONAL PARAMS
- If we need to use useRouter, if needs to be from next/navigation
